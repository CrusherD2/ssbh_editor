# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for taking the time to help improve ssbh_editor! This document covers some guidelines for how to help with development of this application.

## Filing an Issue
Report potential bugs or request new features in [issues](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/ssbh_editor/issues). 
Make sure to check existing issues first to avoid any duplicates. It's possible a feature or bug fix has already been implemented. 
The [changelog](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/ssbh_editor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) gives a brief overview of what changed with each version, 
including unreleased changes that will be included in the next version.

ssbh_editor consists of multiple projects. Please file all bugs or feature requests on ssbh_editor and not any of its dependencies.
This helps prevent any confusion from unrelated issues appearing on other projects. 

## Submitting a Pull Request
Before submitting a PR or starting work on a new change, check to see if there is an existing issue. 
If the issue doesn't exist, make an issue first explaining what you would like changed or improved. 

Make a comment on the issue if you are interested in attempting a PR to implement a fix. 
I'll let you know if it looks doable to implement and try to give a brief overview of the necessary changes that need to be made.
The codebases for ssbh_data and ssbh_wgpu are less beginner friendly than 
ssbh_editor. If an issue on ssbh_editor requires a change to ssbh_data or ssbh_wgpu, 
ask on the ssbh_editor issue first about the difficulty of the required code changes.    

Once you've finished the implementation on your fork, open a PR for review. It's ok if the code isn't perfect or has a few bugs. 
I'll review the code when I'm available and give any feedback on changes that need to be made before merging.
